|[DumpMe](./cyberdefenders/dumpme/REPORT.md)|Enpoint Forensics|_"A SOC analyst took a memory dump from a machine infected with a meterpreter malware. As a Digital Forensicators, your job is to analyze the dump, extract the available indicators of compromise (IOCs) and answer the provided questions."_|
|[Ramnit](./cyberdefenders/ramnit/REPORT.md)|Endpoint Forensics|_"Our intrusion detection system has alerted us to suspicious behavior on a workstation, pointing to a likely malware intrusion. A memory dump of this system has been taken for analysis. Your task is to analyze this dump, trace the malware’s actions, and report key findings."_|
|[Yellow RAT](/cyberdefenders/yellow-rat/REPORT.md)|Threat Intel|_"During a regular IT security check at GlobalTech Industries, abnormal network traffic was detected from multiple workstations.
